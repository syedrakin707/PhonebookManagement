# PhonebookManagement

This is one of the project I have done during my undergraduate life

In this project, there will be a database of phone numbers.
The user will enter a number and if the number is available in the database then the program will show the detailed information about the owner of the number.
The user will be able to add new number with their credentials and if wanted could bring out the table to see the whole database.
From the database the user can delete the number if the number is found to be wrong or outdated.
